# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project is a visual representation of Dijkstra's algorithm implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The algorithm finds the shortest path between two points on a grid, taking into account barriers that the path cannot cross.

## Features

- Visualize the execution of Dijkstra's algorithm on a grid.
- Interactively set the start and end points.
- Create barriers to simulate obstacles.
- Reset the grid to try different scenarios.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Install Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

2. Install Pygame: Install the Pygame library using pip:

```bash

  pip install pygame
```

3. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash   
git clone https://github.com/Kxmrxn-19/Shortest-Path-Finder-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm.git
cd Shortest-Path-Finder-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
```

## Usage
1. Run the Program: Start the program by running the Python script:
```bash 
code.py
```
2.Setting Start and End Points:

- Left-click on any grid cell to set the start point (orange).
- Left-click on another grid cell to set the end point (turquoise).
  
3. Creating Barriers:

- Left-click on grid cells to create barriers (black) that the algorithm cannot pass through.
  
4. Removing Barriers:

- Right-click on grid cells to remove barriers or reset start/end points.
  
5. Start the Algorithm:
   
- Press the SPACE key to start the visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm.
  
6.Reset the Grid:

- Press the F key to reset the grid and start over.
